# 911 calls project

* All code and comments are placed in jupyter notebook file *"911_calls.ipynb"*.  
* Used Python 3.8
* If you want to run it please install all packages from *requirements.txt*.  
* My data are store in *911.csv*. Link to download is in notebook.  
* Creating interactive map via gmaps library require much computing power. That is why I saved inputs as .png files and I placed them in *zdj* directory.
